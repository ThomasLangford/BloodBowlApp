    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value> When using Throw Team-Mate, roll a D6 after he has finished moving, but before he throws his team-mate. On a 1, roll another D6. On another 1, the teammate is killed without any opportunity for recovery. If the team-mate had the ball it will scatter once from the their square.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Skill.Description.BB2.Animosity" xml:space="preserve">
    <value> At the end of their Hand-off or Pass Action attempts to a team-mate who is not of the same race as the Animosity player, roll a D6. On a 1, the player refuses to try to give the ball to any team-mate except one of his own race.

    <value> Immediately after declaring an Action with a Vampire, roll a d6: On a 2+ the Vampire can carry out the Action as normal. However, on a 1, the Vampire must feed on a Thrall team-mate or a spectator. At the end of the declared Action, but before actually Passing, handing off, or scoring, the vampire must feed. Choose a Thrall to bite and make an Injury roll on the Thrall treating any casualty roll as Badly Hurt. Failure to bite a Thrall is a turnover and requires you to feed on a spectator – move the Vampire to the reserves box if he was still on the pitch.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Skill.Description.BB2.Bombardier" xml:space="preserve">
    <value> A coach may choose to have a Bombardier throw a bomb instead of taking any other Action. The bomb is thrown using the rules for throwing the ball (including weather effects and use of Hail Mary Pass), except that the player may not move or stand up before throwing it. Intercepted bomb Passes are not turnovers. All skills that may be used when a ball is thrown may be used when a bomb is thrown also. A bomb may be Intercepted or caught using the same rules for catching the ball, in which case the player catching it must throw it again immediately. The bomb explodes when it lands in an empty square or an opportunity to Catch the bomb fails. When the bomb finally does explode any player in the same square is knocked down, and players in adjacent squares are knocked down on a roll of 4+.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Skill.Description.BB2.Decay" xml:space="preserve">
    <value> When this player suffers a Casualty result on the Injury table, roll twice on the Casualty table and apply both results.

    <value> A player with this skill re-rolls the dice if he fails to dodge out of any tackle zones of an opposing player. In addition, if a blocked player uses the Dodge skill, treat a "Defender Stumbles" result as a "Defender Pushed Back".</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Skill.Description.BB2.DumpOff" xml:space="preserve">

  </data>
  <data name="Skill.Description.BB2.FoulAppearance" xml:space="preserve">
    <value> The player’s appearance is so horrible that any opposing player that wants to block him (or use a special attack that takes the place of a block) must first roll a D6 and score 2 or more.
